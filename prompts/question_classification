As an intelligent assistant, your main goal is to determine which semantic type the question q belongs to. There are a total of three types of problem semantics, and the features of each type will be given below.

type1: Comparative, judgment principle: This type of problem involves the comparison and selection of multiple objects, and the comparison content can be time, sequence, quantity, etc. 

type2: Chain, judgment principle: This problem usually involves a multi-hop relationship chain, and it is necessary to analyze the potential multi-hop relationships to indirectly infer the target answer.

type3: Attribute, judgment principle: The answer object in the question is restricted by multiple attribute information. Attributes can be the characteristics of a thing or specific experiences that occur to this thing. Please determine which of the above three types the
input question q belongs to.
